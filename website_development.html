                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        I developed personalized websites for business clients and clubs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This very site was also built 
                        by me using the same processes. I was able to generate some sales for a short period of time during summer 2023 as a side hustle. 
                    </p>
                </section>

            </div> 

            <div class="container content-column-js">
                <section id="the-process">
                    <h2>The Process & Approach</h2>

                    <h3>
                        Planning and Creation
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I would first discuss with the client what the main purpose for the desired site will be, including what features they want,
                        color scheme, pages, etc. I would point to some refrences from templates, and then tweak and add to them accordingly to their wishes. 
                    </p>

                        <figcaption>Fig. 1: Screenshot of landing page and carousel</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Figure 1 is a screenshot from one of my customers from my school who started a detailing business. After the planning stage where he told
                        me exaclty what he wanted, I started to draw on a white board a visual of what a page of the site would look like, so while creating it I have a 
                        refrence to view. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having an HTML and CSS template to build on saves a ton of time, and makes creating features and other components much more simple.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Checking in with the client so that they can see the progress is also very important, so they can give you information on how to improve it while the site is still 
                        undergoing construction. 
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        I use VSCode as my main code editor, and there are a ton of useful features that make progress go smoothly. For instance, I have an extension 
                        installed which is called LiveServer, which allows me to view my HTML page in real time while editing the code.  
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>
                        Deployment
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        When the site is finished, it's time to deploy it to the internet. I personally use Github Pages to do this, as the process is relatively simple and they
                        also give you a free domain. A custom domain will cost money, but a monthly fee of using a domain from Google Domains will allow for this to happen.  
                    </p>
